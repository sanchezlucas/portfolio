I worked in partnership with Laurent Suaudeau School to make it possible to carry out the courses live and online in the period between 2020 and 2022.

I idealized the promotional materials for the courses, communication, vignettes, transitions and layouts for the livestreams during this period, as well as the workflow to enable transmissions and interaction with the public.
