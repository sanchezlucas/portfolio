Video showing the incredible transformation that Toyota and Revoada are carrying out in Brazil. The aim of the project is to give new meaning to factory waste, which would normally be discarded, transforming them into beautiful backpacks and bags by the skilled seamstresses. Revoada is facilitating the process to empower women, allowing them to expand their product catalog and improve family income.

Award-winning video case at the first Elán Festival.
