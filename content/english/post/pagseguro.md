I was responsible for creating the art for Pagseguro's holidays campaign, with the motto **"In 2023 there will be no space for so many good things"**.

## Testimonials from colleagues:

>Lucas is an excellent professional, very talented, competent and creative. In the 7 months we worked at the same company, I had the misfortune of participating in only one project at his side: a year-end release, in which he created an extremely realistic 3D of metallic balloons, difficult to execute, which was viewed by the 7 thousand employees of the company and praised by many people.
Other than that, his direct colleagues told me several times that they learned daily from him. I strongly recommend Lucas to any company, production company or agency.
