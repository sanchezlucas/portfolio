Hello, my name is Lucas Sanchez dos Anjos, I currently live in the central-eastern region of São Paulo.
In December 2017 I concluded the last semester of the Cinema and Audiovisual course at Universidade Anhembi Morumbi.

During high school I studied concurrently at ETEC Prof. José Rocha Mendes, where he took the Visual Communication course (completed in 2012).


During the cinema course I also developed several short films, exercising activities in the most varied areas of production.
You can find some of them on the Movies page.

starting with an internship as a videomaker at the company Sciere Tecnologias Educacionais developing institutional videos, explainers, interviews and subtitling for companies such as Cia. de Talentos, FMUSP, Santander, Itaú, among others.
I also worked briefly as a freelancer allocated at Maker Haus, where I developed work as a digital designer, videomaker and motion, for brands such as: Mustela, Maple Bear, Acquaterapia, Engecusto and Casa de Makers.


In the meantime, I dedicated myself to taking free courses, courses on experimental cinema, filming on super 8 film and 360° 3D animation for virtual reality.
I worked at OITORAMA/FILMES where I developed motion, 2d cutout animations and 3d animations (being the company's 3d specialist and playing the generalist role) for clients such as Santander, Toyota, Corning, TOTVS, Stryker and Escola Laurent Suaudeau.
I am also a freelancer, responsible for the finalization of short films - O Traje (2018), O Conforto das Ruínas (2020), Nunca Mais Vi Me (2020) and Mamãe Tem um Demônio (2019); and also for the Space Sheep Games monthly newsletter videos.

My most recent job was at Pagseguro, where I worked as a full motion designer, in cutout animation, animation of KVs, stamps, design of 3D advertising pieces, hardsurface modeling and advertising rendering for products that the company offers.

I'm a translation contributor for some free software, KitScenarist, Ephemeral, Starc and others.
