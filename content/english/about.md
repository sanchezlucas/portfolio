Hello, my name is Lucas Sanchez dos Anjos, I'm currently based in São Paulo - Brazil.

I studied Graphic Design at ETEC Prof. José Rocha Mendes, concluded in 2012, and Cinema and Audiovisual at Anhembi Morumbi University, concluded in 2017,

During the cinema course, I also developed several short films, working in the most varied areas of production. You can find some of them on the [Films](/film/) page.

I started with an internship as a videomaker at Sciere Tecnologias Educacionais developing institutional videos, explainers, interviews and subtitling for clients such as Cia. de Talentos, FMUSP, Santander, Itaú, among others.
I also worked briefly as a freelancer allocated at Maker Haus, where I developed work as a digital designer, videomaker and motion designer for brands such as: Mustela, Maple Bear, Acquaterapia and Engecusto.


In the meantime, I dedicated myself to taking free courses on: experimental cinema, super 8 and 360° 3D animation for virtual reality.

I worked at OITORAMA/FILMES on motion design, 2d cutout animations and 3d animations (being the company's 3d specialist and playing the generalist role) for clients such as Santander, Toyota, Corning, TOTVS, Stryker and Escola Laurent Suaudeau.

I am also a freelancer, responsible for the post production of short films - O Traje (2018), O Conforto das Ruínas (2020), Nunca Mais Vi Me (2020) and Mamãe Tem um Demônio (2019); and also for the Space Sheep Games monthly newsletter videos.

My most recent job was at Pagseguro, where I worked as a full motion designer, in cutout animation, animation of KVs, stamps, design of 3D advertising pieces, hardsurface modeling and advertising rendering for products that the company offers.

I'm a translation contributor for some free software: KitScenarist, Ephemeral, Starc and others.
